So github would not upload the g729_plugin

I think the best way would be to use Ronnies code to install his G_CLIENT
(This file here is an edited version of the gstreamer_client that Ronnie's code makes)

if you edit C file then compile with:
gcc -Wall <cfile> -o <compiledfile> -lpthread $(pkg-config --cflags --libs gstreamer-1.0)
