gst-launch-1.0 filesrc location=300hzSineTone.raw ! rawaudioparse use-sink-caps=false format=pcm pcm-format=s16le sample-rate=860 num-channels=1 ! audioconvert ! audioresample ! alsasink


The sine tone should be played through the aux cord
the sine tone I used can be found at

"300 hz sine Tone Amplitude 1"

*****notes for next time
Got the gstreamer to stream premade raw audio file
however, the stream is either extremely short or the audio file is cut short

STREAM IS CUT SHORT BC OF FLOATING POINT ERROR? 

Also eventually: add c code to activate the python code to run the adc
(can just do this by running the c code I wrote) 

So I think the rawaudioparse is reading my file wrong as well
We are inputing raw text but rawaudioparse is expecting 
signed 16bit little-endian

perhaps i can convert my data to signed 16bit little-endian

******************** compiling the test c file
gcc BashScriptRunPython.c -o BashCrunPython

******************** HOW TO COMPILE Jasons_ADCtoGstreamer_client.c
Need to make sure you are using the systems version of python in pyenv
Or whatever version you ./install.sh on 

gcc -Wall Jasons_ADCtoGstreamer_client.c -o Jasons_ADCtoG_CLIENT -lpthread $(pkg-config --cflags --libs gstreamer-1.0)

******************** Tracking changes made to Ronnies code
1. the audio src and sink are changed to alsasrc and alsasink

2. at line 1027: 
	a) I changed audiosource to filesrc so I can use the raw output from adc as source
	b) I changed rate in caps to 860 

*Note seems the g729 encoder needs an inputfile of
*8khz sampled 16 bit PCM (binary)

	c) Changed data rate back to 8000
	d) added rawaudioparse
