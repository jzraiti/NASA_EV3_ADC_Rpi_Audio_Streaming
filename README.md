# NASA_EV3_ADC_Rpi_Audio_Streaming

## Project 1: ADC_Gstreamer






## Project 2: Noise_Cleaning

The audio files were run though the noise cleaning software. The cleaned files can be found in the shared NASA EV3 Raiti folder

In addition:
I added instructions for how to test both noise cleaning softwares 
How to use Deepspeech
How to link Deepspeech and RNNoise to a gstreamer pipeline (should you want to)
