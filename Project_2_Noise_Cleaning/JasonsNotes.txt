Shhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit 

just wanted to get that out my system

Ok

******** trying to get rust package
could it be possible to custom edit the cargo file so i can circumvent the problems


Take a peek into these cargo.toml files
Lets fuc em up eh?









******* get gst-plugins-rs first before rnnoise-gst-rs package 
https://github.com/sdroege/gst-plugin-rs

need?:
sudo apt-get install libssl-dev

must add path to 
/usr/include/i386-linux-gnu/openssl/opensslconf.h

echo $OPENSSL_DIR
export OPENSSL_DIR=$OPENSSL_DIR:/usr/include/i386-linux-gnu/openssl/opensslconf.h


Need?:
pi@raspberry:~/gst-plugin-rs $ which openssl
/usr/bin/openssl
export OPENSSL_DIR=/usr/bin/openssl

Need?:
Set OPENSSL_DIR = /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu
OR Set OPENSSL_LIB_DIR = /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu

NEED?:
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/pkgconfig/

Shiz still dont work
Uh i guess try

pi@raspberry:~/gst-plugin-rs $ export OPENSSL_INCLUDE="/usr/include/openssl"
pi@raspberry:~/gst-plugin-rs $ export OPENSSL_INCLUDE_DIR="/usr/include/openssl"

OK a little closer: different warning #include 
warning: build/expando.c:2:10: fatal error: openssl/opensslconf.h: No such file or directory
warning:  #include <openssl/opensslconf.h>

DEFINITELY NEED:
OPENSSL_INCLUDE_DIR = /usr/include/openssl:/usr/include/i386-linux-gnu/openssl/opensslconf.h

Heres a possible hint:
The openssl compilation is failing, maybe use an older version?
Compiling openssl-sys v0.9.58

SO THIS IS DEFINITELY A PROBLEM, here is the error:
OPENSSL_DIR = /usr/bin/openssl:/usr/include/i386-linux-gnu/openssl/opensslconf.h

  --- stderr
  thread 'main' panicked at 'OpenSSL library directory does not exist: /usr/bin/openssl:/usr/include/i386-linux-gnu/openssl/opensslconf.h/lib', /home/pi/.cargo/registry/src/github.com-1ecc6299db9ec823/openssl-sys-0.9.58/build/main.rs:66:9

Check it out, here is the documentation for rust openssl:
"
OPENSSL_DIR - If specified, the directory of an OpenSSL installation. The directory should contain lib and include subdirectories containing the libraries and headers respectively.
OPENSSL_LIB_DIR and OPENSSL_INCLUDE_DIR - If specified, the directories containing the OpenSSL libraries and headers respectively. This can be used if the OpenSSL installation is split in a nonstandard directory layout.
OPENSSL_STATIC - If set, the crate will statically link to OpenSSL rather than dynamically link.
OPENSSL_LIBS - If set, a :-separated list of library names to link to (e.g. ssl:crypto). This can be used if nonstandard library names were used for whatever reason.
OPENSSL_NO_VENDOR - If set, always find OpenSSL in the system, even if the vendored feature is enabled.
"

so first check with
apt-file list libssl-dev

then set
OPENSSL_INCLUDE_DIR = /usr/include/openssl/

then set
OPENSSL_LIB_DIR=/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/

next problem: 
warning: build/expando.c:2:10: fatal error: openssl/opensslconf.h: No such file or directory
warning:  #include <openssl/opensslconf.h>
warning:           ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
warning: compilation terminated.

Solution?
just a note: CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH and C_INCLUDE_PATH are not the equivalent of LD_LIBRARY_PATH. LD_LIBRARY_PATH serves the ld (the dynamic linker at runtime) whereas the equivalent of the former two that serves your C/C++ compiler with the location of libraries is LIBRARY_PATH.

So I try:
export C_INCLUDE_PATH=/usr/include/i386-linux-gnu/

SOLVED!!!
***** NEW ERROR IN CARGO BUILD for gst-plugin-rs

*****Trying to install gstreamer-rs
maybe we gotta try getting gstreamer-rs

pkg-config --libs gtk+-2.0

/usr/bin/ld: skipping incompatible //usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libglib-2.0.a when searching for -lglib-2.0

ok say what, I need to look into these files, they are incompatible because they are 32 bit and the other shiz is 64 bit, maybe I can find the 32 bit versions...

May be easier to try using a different os to make this work? NO
cant do that, I gotta use this because its the only way to use ronnies

"We’re depending on the gst-plugin crate, which provides all the basic infrastructure for implementing GStreamer plugins and elements. In addition we depend on the gstreamer, gstreamer-base and gstreamer-video crates for various GStreamer API that we’re going to use later, and the glib crate to be able to use some GLib API that we’ll need. GStreamer is building upon GLib, and this leaks through in various places."

Start building package with
cargo init -–lib -–name gst-plugin-tutorial

compile the project with 
cargo build


*** SUPER USEFUL NOTE HAS APPEARED ***
To allow GStreamer to find our new plugin and make it available in every GStreamer-based application, we could install it into the system- or user-wide GStreamer plugin path or simply point the GST_PLUGIN_PATH environment variable to the directory containing it:
export GST_PLUGIN_PATH= something/target/debug (aka path to directory containing the plugins .so file) 

********To build a "cargo" package *********
you need a Cargo.toml 
and a corresponding src/lib.rs
